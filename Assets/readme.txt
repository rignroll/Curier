Edy's Vehicle Physics is a set of scripts for developing realistic and fun vehicles in your game. Designed for gameplay, ease of use, and physically realistic behavior. Features:

- Drag & Play! 4 pre-configured vehicle prefabs with different features and behaviors
- Vehicles work out of the box by dragging the prefabs into any existing scene
- Full-featured sound controller, from engine and wind to scratches and wheel bump effects
- Complete, fully working demo project
- Version archive an download via GIT repository (http://projects.edy.es/trac/edy_vehicle-physics)


How to play the demo scene:
1- Import the package into an EMPTY project
2- Quit Unity, then move the InputManager.asset file to the project's ProjectSettings folder
3- Open the project in Unity, load the scene TheCity and click Play. Done!

How to use the vehicles in your project:
1- Selectively import the package: Import everything but the folders World and Standard Assets (you should already have them in your project)
2- Drag any of the vehicle prefabs from Vehicles\Prefabs into your scene
3- Click Play. The vehicle is already working. You may want to configure your camera for chasing it.
